Associated with Syracuse University NEXIS Student Technology Lab

Led team of four to optimize exercise recommendations by integrating individual health factors and exercise completion data. 
Our model establishes the relationship between various health metrics (workout intensity, weight, calories burned, gender, age, duration, etc.). 
Utilizing regression algorithms including decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and KNeighbors, a recommendation system was developed, 
capable of suggesting personalized exercise intensities.
